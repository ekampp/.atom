# Atom RSpec Package

----

**Warning: This package is alpha and probably buggy,** but we decided to share
our progress for those who are interested. Proceed at your own risk!

-----

Add ability to run RSpec and see the output without leaving Atom.

You can open a new terminal with **ctrl-`** or from the command palette
via **cmd-p**, typing 'terminal', and selecting the 'Terminal: Open' command.
